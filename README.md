One day, my old running friend and I were chatting about our running styles, training habits, and achievements, when I suddenly realized that I could take an in-depth analytical look at my training. I have been using a popular GPS fitness tracker called Runkeeper for years and decided it was time to analyze my running data to see how I was doing.
Since 2012, I've been using the Runkeeper app, and it's great. One key feature: its excellent data export. Anyone who has a smartphone can download the app and analyze their data like we will do in this notebook.
After logging your run, the first step is to export the data from Runkeeper (which I've done already). Then import the data and start exploring to find potential problems. After that, create data cleaning strategies to fix the issues. Finally, analyze and visualize the clean time- series data. I exported seven years worth of my training data, from 2012 through 2018. The data is a CSV file where each row is a single training activity. Let's load and inspect it.

Each of the above sub-section has been represented in the form of dashboards which are created using Python language on Google Colab and different packages. These Data Frames use a wide array of functions and packages in pandas to create intuitive and drillable Data Frames, which can then be used by the firm to analyze the situation and draw conclusions about the same. 


This project focuses on importing the data and start exploring to find potential problems. After that, create data cleaning strategies to fix the issues. Finally, analyze and visualize the clean time-series data.Also to find Totals for different training types like Cycling , Running and Walking.


The project consists of detailed as follows:

With the explosion in fitness tracker popularity, runners all of the world are collecting data with gadgets (smartphones, watches, etc.) to keep themselves motivated. They look for answers to questions like:

•	How fast, long, and intense was my run today?


•	Have I succeeded with my training goals?


•	Am I progressing?


•	What were my best achievements?


•	How do I perform compared to others?


This data was exported from Runkeeper:

•		The data is a CSV file where each row is a single training activity.
•	In this project, we will create import, clean, and analyze my data to answer the above questions.
